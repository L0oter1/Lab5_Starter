1. It is generally good practice not just for HTML, CSS, and JS to always have relavant names for your variables in programming and I don't feel any different for HTML, CSS, and JS. Everything depends on one another and when you create IDs & Classes that don't put any thought into it, your code becomes repetitive and also hard to follow which is bad for anyone trying to follow along to add to your code later on.

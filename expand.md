1. It is generally good practice not just for HTML, CSS, and JS to always have relavant names for your variables in programming and I don't feel any different for HTML, CSS, and JS. Everything depends on one another and when you create IDs & Classes that don't put any thought into it, your code becomes repetitive and also hard to follow which is bad for anyone trying to follow along to add to your code later on.
2. Data attributes are ways we can store information in our code such as id, classes, and object variabl;es. They are useful for scalability and resuability. You access them with .dataset in js. With microdata, it adds meaning to html and it's not just code or variables but it means something that humans can understand.
3. DOM fragment is a DOM node that is used when you want to append elements by creating a DOM to attach. 
4. The DOM allows your javascript to interact with the HTML. It splits HTML into different objects which js can interact with to create an interactive web page. You gain efficiency, and you can resuse code. You lose through abstraction which makes it a bit harder to understand what is exactly happening when there is an error.
5. In Javascript, class is a reserved keyword so that's why it uses className instead.
6. EventListener allows for multiple events for the same thing while onClick would override the previous onClick.
